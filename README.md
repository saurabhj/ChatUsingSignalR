# Chat using Signal R and Auth using WCF
---
This project runs a chat server with a group-chat window and private chats between people using the SignalR2 framework.

It also provides a very thin authentication wrapper using WCF and the new Microsoft's Identity Authentication. (I know this is all crazy). I was just trying out a bunch of different things.

Basically, this project will help you grasp the very basic fundamentals of:

1. Signal R

2. How to create a very basic WCF service. Help from [here](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/531332/Implementing-a-Basic-Hello-World-WCF-Service-v)

3. How to implement a very basic level Identity Based Authentication. Help from [here](http://www.khalidabuhakmeh.com/asp-net-mvc-5-authentication-breakdown-part-deux)

If you have any specific questions or requests, please shout out.
I'm not sure if I am going to make any more fixes to this project unless something is truly broken.
